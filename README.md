# 🚀 About Me  
🎓 Recent Computer Science graduate from the University of British Columbia and former varsity cross-country/track athlete. I have a passion for building interactive, user-focused software.

🧠 I enjoy solving problems across the stack and have experience in full-stack web development, game programming, and data-driven systems.

💡 I’ve built dynamic web apps using React and Flask, developed a turn-based RPG in C++ with OpenGL, and implemented SQL databases for real-world data exploration.

🔍 Actively seeking opportunities in full-stack, backend, or game development roles.
